# optimization


## How to run

Use test.m with the pre-defined configurations.

This script conducts the optimization of quadratic(dim-100), log, and bi-quadratic functions. The gradient descent, Newton, and Q-Newton methods are applied for all of the functions. 

To run the code, please:

  1) specify the pathes of `b`, `c`, and `A` of lof funtion, i.e., in log_proj2.m  grad_log.m, and hessian_log.m.
  2) specify the function that would like to optimize by determing `func_choose` as `quad_100`, `log`, or `bi_quad`.
